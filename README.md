# tiffanyHo_exploreOpenSource
This project is part of the Explore Open Source Challenge through Girls Who Code and College Loops. In this challenge, we responded to the following prompt:  Delilah is a self-starter, and she created an app to get young girls excited about learning technology. Many kids have already tested the app, and she has been getting very positive reviews.  Since Delilah sourced most of her user-testers through her network, their backgrounds are all very similar to hers. Delilah wants her app to be more inclusive, but she doesn’t know how to find and approach more potential user-testers from underrepresented minorities. What can be some first steps?  My response to the prompt is below:
Tiffany
Delilah could include more photos reflective/representative of her target audience. She can also start out by replacing a photo or two with young girls from a variety of backgrounds in the case that adding extra/more photos is too much for a start. In the future, Delilah can keep in mind who her target audience is and can make sure that any content she adds does so.

Great response!  I definitely agree with the points you brought up--specifically how you recommended that she be more mindful of her content in the future.

I agree that including more pictures that are more representative of the target audience would help with the issue, but one thing that might be an issue is that there is no way to fully ensure people’s participation is full.
Tiffany - Revised
I would revise my suggestion by keeping everything I have and including a section in the mission statement that emphasizes the goal of diversity and inclusion.
Since there is no way to ensure that all demographics are covered through photos, this section should try to represent the goal of diversity and inclusion as much as possible.
To reflect the mission to reach all demographics, Delilah should also see which demographics she is lacking in her membership and should devote more resources to increasing the populations that she has yet to reach or that is still not as large as the others.
